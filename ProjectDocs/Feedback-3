Randomalization for artifacts, making a system for showing them ABC/ BAC and so on, turn it off or on?
Drafts on top of the homepage? Whatever you put on top is whats most important/ the first thing they see
Demographics HIGH priority, permission, remove or add stuff if they need to
Making the UX for buttons its important for the understanding of the page

Call session data something else
Language of the user, think beyond what makes sense to use
Artifacts uploading, more than one at a time 
Existing artifacts is nice to have not must have

Create questions, without gluing artifacts to each questions (show that this is possible)
Sliding scale should not always be a slide, support different types ( best to worst, radio buttons, wrong term)
Required question has be to choosen by the researcher, has to be connected to the make study page

More roles than researcher and admin, add functionality to include study-collaborators etc.
Deleting data, show "are u sure?" Take care of this, take measures to prevent accidental deletion

Autharization 
For participants, who ever has a link can access (might be an issue) 
If we do it this was security implecations
When a researcher clicks to copy a link to the study, a token is created and that participant id is stored in the database
